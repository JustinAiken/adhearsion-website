<h1>Download Adhearsion</h1>


<h2>Latest Adhearsion Release</h2>

<p>If you're not familiar with Ruby, virtually all Ruby software is distributed through the use of RubyGems, the official Ruby package management system. If you don't have RubyGems installed, see the section below entitled "Installing RubyGems".</p>

<p>With RubyGems installed, simply type the following command to install Adhearsion:</p>

<pre>sudo gem install adhearsion</pre>

<p>And that's it! You now have the "ahn" command and can create and execute Adhearsion applications. Go read one of the Getting Started guides in the left toolbar for help writing your first application.</p>

<p>Note: Windows users shouldn't prefix the gem command with sudo.</p>

<h2>Edge Adhearsion</h2>

<p>The latest and greatest of Adhearsion, called "Edge Adhearsion," can be found on <a href="http://github.com/jicksta/adhearsion">the Adhearsion Github project</a>. There are two ways to download Edge Adhearsion from Github: using the git Source Code Management (SCM) tool or an auto-generated tarball snapshot.</p>

<p>To download the code with git, type...</p>

<pre>git clone git://github.com/jicksta/adhearsion.git</pre>
  
<p>Or download <a href="http://github.com/jicksta/adhearsion/tarball/master">the latest tarball</a> of Edge Adhearsion from Github without git.</p>

<p>The code on the Github master branch is usually always stable and usable. Most of the development of Adhearsion actually happens on separate branches (git makes branching extremely easy) and Jay merges the changes into master when they're ready. This keeps the master branch relatively stable but not entirely up-to-date feature-wise. If you wish to browse activity on other branches, check out Github's <a href="http://github.com/jicksta/adhearsion/network">Network Viewer</a>.

<h2>Getting Ruby</h2>

<p>



<p>Note: For the sake of JRuby compatibility, Adhearsion does not presently work on Ruby v1.9, though most Ruby software has not moved over to Ruby 1.9 yet, including gems you might want to use. When JRuby has full, stable Ruby v1.9 support, Adhearsion will become Ruby 1.9 compatible.</p>

<h2>Installing RubyGems</h2>

<h3>Mac OS X Leopard</h3>

<p>If you use Leopard, you already have RubyGems!</p>
  
<p>You may need to update RubyGems itself by doing "sudo gem update --system".</p>

<h3>All other platforms</h3>

<p>Read <a href="http://www.rubygems.org/read/chapter/3">this guide</a> on how to install RubyGems.</p>

<p>Note: Adhearsion is not <em>guaranteed</em> to work as advertised on Windows. Read the <a href="/faq">FAQ</a> for more info.</p>
