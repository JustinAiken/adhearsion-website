<h2>Adhearsion is for Ruby on Rails?</h2>

<p>This is one of the biggest misconceptions about Adhearsion. It should be strongly stressed that Adhearsion is a Ruby framework, <strong>not</strong> a Ruby on Rails framework. Ruby on Rails, a <strong>web</strong> development framework, is probably the most popular Ruby software, but it has little to do with the Ruby language per se besides simply using it. The Ruby language is a general purpose programming language with which both Ruby on Rails and Adhearsion are written.</p>

<p>Adhearsion does help facilitate integration with Rails applications and it shares a few libraries with Rails, such as ActiveSupport and ActiveRecord.</p>

<h2>How can Adhearsion talk to landline or cell phones without special hardware?</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>What is Asterisk?</h2>
<p>Asterisk is an open-source telephony-engine which Adhearsion abstracts.</p>

<h2>Something is behaving strangely. Is it an Adhearsion bug?</h2>
<p>Maybe.</p>

<h2>How do I contribute my patch?</h2>
<p>Adhearsion uses Github.com to manage all patches. See the <a href="/contributing">Contributing</a> page for more information.</p>

<h2>Why Ruby?</h2>
<p>For a couple reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ruby strongly promotes code-reuse through first-class Object Oriented Programming.</li>
  <li>Ruby is a beautiful language</li>
  <li>Ruby has many interpreters, drastically extending the code-reuse potential.</li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<h2>How mature is the project?</h2>
<p>2.5 years</p>

<h2>Do I have to recompile Asterisk to use Adhearsion?</h2>
<p>Nope!</p>

<h2>Can I try Adhearsion safely on my production Asterisk machine?</h2>
<p>Yep! You can have a special SIP account route exclusively to Adhearsion very easily, leaving the rest of the logic perfectly intact. You can even have a single <em>extension</em> route to Adhearsion if you'd like.</p>

<p>Can't guarantee that Asterisk won't die (likely through race conditions causing a segfault) or suffer memory leaks from Adhearsion using its API. For example, the Asterisk Manager Interface feature of Asterisk (which Adhearsion optionally uses) used to cause crashes. Nothing in Adhearsion is particularly abusive, but Asterisk has been known to arbitrarily fall over. For a production phone system, you should always consider using a process watchdog such as <a href="http://mmonit.com/monit">monit</a>.</p>
