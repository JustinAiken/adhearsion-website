<h2>Adhearsion is for Ruby on Rails?</h2>

<p>This is one of the biggest misconceptions about Adhearsion. It should be strongly stressed that Adhearsion is a Ruby framework, <strong>not</strong> a Ruby on Rails plugin or the like. Ruby on Rails, a <strong>web</strong> development framework, is probably the most popular Ruby software, but it has little to do with the Ruby language per se besides simply using it. The Ruby language is a general purpose programming language with which both Ruby on Rails and Adhearsion are written.</p>

<p>Adhearsion does help facilitate integration with Rails applications and it shares a few libraries with Rails, such as ActiveSupport and ActiveRecord.</p>

<h2>How can Adhearsion talk to landline or cell phones without special hardware?</h2>

<p>This is usually so simple that it can catch people by surprise. With the proliferation of VoIP over the past few years, many VoIP providers have sprung up which offer very inexpensive so-called "termination" services. Skype and Vonage are popular examples of these. The term "termination" simply means that they operate the technologies that turn a VoIP call made up of internet packets into a phone call on the entirely separate public telephone network.</p>
  
<p>When funneling all calls through a service provider like this, it's often called "trunking" because, like the trunk of a tree, the many branches converge into one big point all the way to the ground where the roots then branch from the tree.</p>

<p>The following diagram should help illustrate how it works.</p>

<img src="/images/telephony-topology.jpg" alt="Diagram of telephony topology"/>

<p>The VoIP protocol most often used for the VoIP calling is called Session Initiation Protocol or SIP. If you're looking for services which offer this, try googling for "sip trunk" or "sip termination service".</p>

<h2>What is Asterisk?</h2>

<p>Asterisk is an open-source telephony-engine which Adhearsion uses to handle low-level telephony details. Asterisk is written in C for performance and talks to Adhearsion via a socket-based protocols.</p>

<p>Asterisk is normally extremely difficult to use and has been the source of the inordinately high barrier to entry for potential voice application developers. Adhearsion not only abstracts Asterisk but provides things it has never offered and likely never will offer. There is virtually nothing you can do in Asterisk that you can't also Adhearsion. Adhearsion is a very large <em>superset</em> of Asterisk functionality.</p>

<h2>Something is behaving strangely. Is it an Adhearsion bug?</h2>
<p>It's very possible. The most common points of failure or peculiarities are at the SIP trunk level, the Asterisk level, at the Adhearsion framework level and at the application (your code) level. You can try asking on the <a href="/irc">IRC channel</a> or <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/adhearsion">the mailing list</a> for help. If it turns out to be an Adhearsion framework bug, please <a href="http://adhearsion.lighthouseapp.com">file a bug report</a>.</p>

<h2>How do I contribute my patch?</h2>
<p>Adhearsion uses Github.com to manage all patches. See the <a href="/contributing">Contributing</a> page for more information.</p>

<h2>Why Ruby?</h2>
<p>For a couple reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ruby strongly promotes code-reuse through first-class Object Oriented Programming.</li>
  <li>Ruby code emphasizes being clean and concise</li>
  <li>Ruby has many interpreters, drastically extending the code-reuse potential. The main alternative interpreter is JRuby, a stable interpreter capable of running Adhearsion atop the JVM, but other interpreters are in the works for .NET, Objective-C and Smalltalk.</li>
  <li>Ruby has a fantastic package manager named RubyGems which makes code reuse even easier and simpler.</li>
  <li>The Ruby community is full of very intelligent, pragmatic individuals with a culture like none other. Things such as Agile software development
  <li>Adhearsion wants to attract people who get excited about learning new things.</li>
  
</ul>

<p>If you've never used Ruby before, I recommend playing with the <a href="http://tryruby.hobix.com">online interactive Ruby tutorial</a> to get a feel for the language. Even if you've never programmed before, give it a try! I think you'll see what we mean by simple and clean.</p>

<h2>Is Adhearsion a MVC framework?</h2>
<p>No.</p>

<h2>Can Adhearsion do Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)?</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Can Adhearsion do Text to Speech (TTS)?</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Is Ruby slow?</h2>
<p>TODO. The telephony engine beneath Adhearsion will likely break down before Adhearsion does.</p>

<h2>How mature is the project?</h2>
<p>Adhearsion is production-worthy but, like most software, don't consider it to be totally bug-free. Adhearsion was first released on Christmas of 2006 publicly, though its inception dates many months prior to that.</p>

<h2>Does Adhearsion run on Windows?</h2>
<p>Not officially.</p>

<h2>Why doesn't Adhearsion support Ruby 1.9?</h2>

<p>Adhearsion works with Ruby 1.8.x versions of Adhearsion (starting at 1.8.6) and JRuby 1.1 or later. JRuby has the distinct advantage of being able to run Adhearsion on the Java Virtual Machine, allowing you to use virtually any Java library in existence right in your Adhearsion application. The normal Ruby interpreter has fewer dependencies and is what's generally used in Adhearsion applications at the time being.</p>

<h2>Do I have to recompile Asterisk to use Adhearsion?</h2>

<p>Not at all! Adhearsion communicates with Asterisk via a socket. You can use Adhearsion on a vanilla Asterisk v1.4 system.</p>

<h2>Can I try Adhearsion safely on my production Asterisk machine?</h2>
<p>Yep! You can have a special SIP account route exclusively to Adhearsion very easily, leaving the rest of the logic perfectly intact. You can even have a single <em>extension</em> route to Adhearsion if you'd like.</p>

<p>Can't guarantee that Asterisk won't die (likely through race conditions causing a segfault) or suffer memory leaks from Adhearsion using its API. For example, the Asterisk Manager Interface feature of Asterisk (which Adhearsion optionally uses) used to cause crashes. Nothing in Adhearsion is particularly abusive, but Asterisk has been known to arbitrarily fall over. For a production phone system, you should always consider using a process watchdog such as <a href="http://mmonit.com/monit">monit</a>.</p>

<h2>How does Adhearsion run on the JVM?</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://jruby.codehaus.org">JRuby</a> interpreter is a full re-implementation of the Ruby programming langauge using only Java. Adhearsion strives to maintain 100% compatibility with the mainline Ruby interpreter (called Matz's Ruby Interpreter or MRI) and JRuby.</p>
