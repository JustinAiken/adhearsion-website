<h2>Adhearsion is for Ruby on Rails?</h2>

<p>This is one of the biggest misconceptions about Adhearsion. It should be strongly stressed that Adhearsion is a Ruby framework, <strong>not</strong> a Ruby on Rails framework. Ruby on Rails, a <strong>web</strong> development framework, is probably the most popular Ruby software, but it has little to do with the Ruby language per se besides simply using it. The Ruby language is a general purpose programming language with which both Ruby on Rails and Adhearsion are written.</p>

<p>Adhearsion does help facilitate integration with Rails applications and it shares a few libraries with Rails, such as ActiveSupport and ActiveRecord.</p>

<h2>How can Adhearsion talk to landline or cell phones without special hardware?</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>What is Asterisk?</h2>
<p>Asterisk is an open-source telephony-engine which Adhearsion abstracts.</p>

<h2>Something is behaving strangely. Is it an Adhearsion bug?</h2>
<p>Maybe.</p>

<h2>How do I contribute my patch?</h2>
<p>Adhearsion uses Github.com to manage all patches. See the <a href="/contributing">Contributing</a> page for more information.</p>

<h2>Why Ruby?</h2>
<p>For a couple reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ruby strongly promotes code-reuse through first-class Object Oriented Programming.</li>
  <li>Ruby code emphasizes being clean and concise</li>
  <li>Ruby has many interpreters, drastically extending the code-reuse potential. The main alternative interpreter is JRuby, a stable interpreter capable of running Adhearsion atop the JVM, but other interpreters are in the works for .NET, Objective-C and Smalltalk.</li>
  <li>Ruby has a fantastic package manager named RubyGems which makes code reuse even easier and simpler.</li>
  <li>The Ruby community is full of very intelligent, pragmatic individuals with a culture like none other. Things such as Agile software development
  <li>Adhearsion wants to attract people who get excited about learning new things.</li>
  
</ul>

<h2>How mature is the project?</h2>
<p>Adhearsion is production-worthy but, like most software, don't consider it to be totally bug-free. Adhearsion was first released on Christmas of 2006 publicly, though its inception dates many months prior to that.</p>

<h2>Does Adhearsion run on Windows?</h2>
<p>Not officially.</p>

<h2>Why doesn't Adhearsion support Ruby 1.9?</h2>

<p>Adhearsion works with Ruby 1.8.x versions of Adhearsion (starting at 1.8.6) and JRuby 1.1 or later. JRuby has the distinct advantage of being able to run Adhearsion on the Java Virtual Machine, allowing you to use virtually any Java library in existence right in your Adhearsion application. The normal Ruby interpreter has fewer dependencies and is what's generally used in Adhearsion applications at the time being.</p>

<h2>Do I have to recompile Asterisk to use Adhearsion?</h2>
<p>Nope!</p>

<h2>Can I try Adhearsion safely on my production Asterisk machine?</h2>
<p>Yep! You can have a special SIP account route exclusively to Adhearsion very easily, leaving the rest of the logic perfectly intact. You can even have a single <em>extension</em> route to Adhearsion if you'd like.</p>

<p>Can't guarantee that Asterisk won't die (likely through race conditions causing a segfault) or suffer memory leaks from Adhearsion using its API. For example, the Asterisk Manager Interface feature of Asterisk (which Adhearsion optionally uses) used to cause crashes. Nothing in Adhearsion is particularly abusive, but Asterisk has been known to arbitrarily fall over. For a production phone system, you should always consider using a process watchdog such as <a href="http://mmonit.com/monit">monit</a>.</p>
