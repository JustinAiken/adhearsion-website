This is the Adhearsion documentation site

Requirements (most of these can be installed with easy_install, case SeNsItIvE!):
* ansi2html
* pexpect
* Markdown

Dexy must be installed from Git:

git clone git://github.com/ananelson/dexy.git
cd dexy
pip install -e .

Note that if you are using the default Python with OSX you will need to run the easy_install and pip as root *or* have write permissions on /usr/local/bin.

To generate the documentation, run rake docs in the top level directory and navigate to localhost:9292/docs (you must run the sinatra app).
