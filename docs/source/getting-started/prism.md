# Using Adhearsion with PRISM

## Requirements
* [Voxeo PRISM version 11.0 or later (11.5 recommended)](http://voxeolabs.com/prism)
* [rayo-server.war]

While PRISM itself is a commercial product, a free license with 2-port concurrency is available to developers.  Also, the "rayo-server" application is open source and can be found on its [Github repository](https://github.com/rayo/rayo-server).

## Getting PRISM


## Configuring PRISM

### Licensing PRISM

If you are using a Rayo server, you will need to configure your JID and password and ensure that the DIDs have been mapped to your selected JID. Refer to your Rayo server's documentation for how to do this.  You likely will also want to configure your root_domain to point to your Rayo server's domain name for routing outbound calls.
